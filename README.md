# VR Logix Rotation Fix
A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/neos-modding-group/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that rotates spawned logix nodes to use the same rotation as the user when in VR.<br>

Pull Request currently open for [LogixUtils](https://github.com/badhaloninja/LogixUtils) here: [Pull Request](https://github.com/badhaloninja/LogixUtils/pull/2)


## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/neos-modding-group/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [NMLUpdater.dll](https://github.com/AlexW-578/VRLogixRotateFix/releases/latest/download/VRLogixRotateFix.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
5. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.

## Options:
- Enabled - Enables and disables the whole mod
